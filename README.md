1. Reverse digits of an integer.
Example 1:
Input: 123                   Output: 321

2. Check if two strings are anagrams of each other
3. Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.
Example:
Input: x = 1, y = 4                    Output: 2
Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.
4. Given an array of characters, compress it in-place.The length after compression must always be smaller than or equal to the original array.
Input:
["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]
Output:
Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]
